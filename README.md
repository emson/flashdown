# Flashdown: Flash cards & Markdown

Welcome to Flashdown, a flash card tool writen with developers in mind
and uses sensible libraries for buliding and managing your flash cards.







## TODO

- Add Commander gem for commandline handling
- Add Redis for persistance store
- Load Markdown files into store



## Contributing to Flashdown
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been
  implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't
  requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it
  in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you
  want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is
fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around
it.
